    <b>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that emphasizes readability and simplicity. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991
    <br>    
    Python has grown to become one of the most widely used programming languages globally. Its clean syntax allows developers to express concepts in fewer lines of code,
    <br>
    making it accessible for beginners.</b>
    <br>
<b>Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming, which adds to its versatility.
<br>    
It is widely utilized in various fields such as web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and automation.</b>
<b>
<br>    
The language boasts an extensive standard library and a rich ecosystem of third-party libraries and frameworks, such as Django, Flask, NumPy,
<br>
and Pandas. Additionally, Python's active community provides numerous resources, tutorials, and forums to assist learners and professionals alike.</b>


    <h2><u>Key Features</u></h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><u>Easy to Learn and Use:</u></strong> <b style="color: blue;"> Python's syntax is designed to be readable and straightforward, making it an excellent choice for beginners.
        <br>
        The language emphasizes code clarity, allowing new programmers to quickly grasp concepts.
        <br>
        </b></li>
        <br>
        <li><strong><u>Interpreted Language:</u></strong> <b style="color: blue;"> Python is executed line by line, which makes debugging easier and allows for interactive programming.
        <br>    
        Developers can test code snippets in real-time without needing a separate compilation step.</b></li>
        <br>
        <li><strong><u>Extensive Libraries and Frameworks:</u></strong> <b style="color: blue;"> Python has a vast ecosystem of libraries (like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib)
        <br>    
        and frameworks (such as Django and Flask) that simplify complex tasks and speed up development.</b></li>
        <br>
        <li><strong><u>Cross-Platform Compatibility:</u></strong> <b style="color: blue;">Python can run on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux,
        <br>
        making it a versatile choice for developers.</b> </li>
        <br>
        <li><strong><u>Strong Community Support:</u></strong><b style="color: blue;">Python boasts a large and active community, providing numerous resources, forums,
        <br>    
        and documentation that assist users in solving problems and learning new concepts.</b> </li>
    </ul>

    <h2><u>Advantages</u></h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><u>Readable and Maintainable Code:</u></strong><b style="color: blue;"> Pythonâ€™s emphasis on readability means that code is easier to maintain and understand. 
        <br>    
        This is crucial for collaborative projects where multiple developers work on the same codebase.</li></b>
        <br>
        <li><strong><u>Rapid Development:</u></strong><b style="color: blue;">Python allows for faster prototyping and development due to its simple syntax and extensive libraries. 
        <br>    
        Developers can focus more on problem-solving rather than syntax issues.</li></b> 
        <br>
        <li><strong><u>Diverse Application Areas:</u></strong><b style="color: blue;">Python is applicable in various fields, from web development to data science and machine learning,
        <br>    
        making it a versatile tool for developers.</li></b> 
    </ul>

    <h2>Disadvantages</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><u>Slower Execution Speed:</u></strong><b style="color: blue;"> Python is generally slower than compiled languages like C or C++ because it is interpreted at runtime.
        <br>    
        This can be a drawback for performance-critical applications.</li></b>
        <br>
        <li><strong><u>High Memory Consumption:</u></strong><b style="color: blue;">Python's dynamic typing and high-level data structures can lead to increased memory usage compared to 
        <br>    
        lower-level languages, which may be an issue in memory-constrained environments.</li></b>
        <br>
        <li><strong><u>Not Ideal for Mobile Development:</u></strong><b style="color: blue;"> While there are frameworks for mobile app development (like Kivy), Python is not the primary choice 
        <br>    
        for mobile applications, with languages like Swift and Kotlin being more prevalent.</li></b>
    </ul>

    <h2><u>Basic Syntax Examples</u></h2>
    <pre>
 <b><u>Hello World Example</u></b>
  <b>
    print("Hello, World!")
  </b>
<u><b>Simple Function</b></u>
<b>
    def add(a, b):
    return a + b

</b>
<u><b>Using the Function</b></u>
 <b>
    result = add(5, 3)
    print("The sum is:", result)
    
 </b>
<b><u> Conditional Statement</u></b>
<b>
    a = 10
    b = 20
    if a > b:
        print("A is greater than B")
    else:
        print("B is greater than or equal to A")
      

</b>
  </pre>

    <h2><u>Practice Questions</u></h2>
    <div class="practice-question">
        <p>1.<b style="color: blue;"> Write a Python function to calculate the factorial of a number using recursion.</p></b>
        <p>2. <b style="color: blue;"> Create a program that checks if a given number is prime.</p></b>
        <p>3. <b style="color: blue;"> Write a function that returns the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number <code>n</code>.</p></b>
